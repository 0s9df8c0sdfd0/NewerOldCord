# NewerOldCord

**A personal passion project to bring back the previous Discord UI.**  
_NewerOldCord is a fork of OldCord, revamped to look more like the Discord interface that was just replaced — keeping the classic layout, but updating the visuals to feel more in line with recent design._

## ❗ Disclaimer

Hey there! Just a quick heads-up:

**NewerOldCord** is a fork of the original **OldCord** theme. With Discord rolling out a brand new UI, the old OldCord layout started to feel a bit outdated — so I decided to give it a refresh.

The goal of this project is to **update OldCord to better resemble the Discord UI that was just retired**, keeping the structure of the older layout while modernizing it to look more like the recent version that many users were familiar with.

I'm very much an **amateur** — not a CSS expert — and this is all built through trial, error, and lots of tweaking. I'm learning as I go and will keep making improvements as I figure things out.

I made this theme for myself, but figured others might also want a cleaner, more familiar feel. Feel free to use, fork, or build on it. Just note that I may not be able to provide support or frequent updates.

Thanks for checking it out!
