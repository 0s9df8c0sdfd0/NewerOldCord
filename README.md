# NewerOldCord

**A personal project to bring back the previous Discord UI.**  
_2021OldCord is a fork of [NewerOldCord]([https://github.com/milbits/oldcord](https://github.com/FrCynda/NewerOldCord)), revamped to look more like the Discord interface that was from 2021_.

# Need Old UI Screenshots

I'm missing a lot of visual references from the old Discord UI for my theme. Stuff like:

    Pinned messages
    Inbox / Mentions
    Server settings
    Notification dropdowns
    User popouts / profiles
    Member list or role popups

I don’t have many screenshots of those, and memory does NOT serve me well. If you have anything, screenshots, clips, whatever—post them on this [server](https://discord.gg/aAHWPZHfs2). Even rough ones help a lot.


## ❗ Disclaimer

**2021OldCord** is a fork of the original **OldCord** theme. With Discord rolling out a brand new UI, the old OldCord layout started to feel a bit outdated — so I decided to give it a refresh.



I'm very much an **amateur** — not a CSS expert — and this is all built through trial, error, and lots of tweaking. This is not going to be a long term project, I'm only doing this for myself for now and sharing it. The theme will break with subsequent discord updates, I do not know if I'll have the motivation or will to fix issues that will arise in the future.
