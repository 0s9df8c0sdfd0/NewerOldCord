# NewerOldCord

**A personal project to bring back the previous Discord UI.**  
_NewerOldCord is a fork of [OldCord](https://github.com/milbits/oldcord), revamped to look more like the Discord interface that was just replaced — keeping the classic layout, but updating the visuals to feel more in line with recent design._

## ❗ Disclaimer

**NewerOldCord** is a fork of the original **OldCord** theme. With Discord rolling out a brand new UI, the old OldCord layout started to feel a bit outdated — so I decided to give it a refresh.

The goal of this project is to **update OldCord to better resemble the Discord UI that was just retired**, keeping the structure of the older layout while modernizing it to look more like the recent version that many users were familiar with.

I'm very much an **amateur** — not a CSS expert — and this is all built through trial, error, and lots of tweaking. This is not going to be a long term project, I'm only doing this for myself for now and sharing it. The theme will break with subsequent discord updates, I do not know if I'll have the motivation or will to fix issues that will arise in the future.
