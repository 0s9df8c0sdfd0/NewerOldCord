# OldCord

A [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app " ") theme that reverts almost everything like it was in 2020

# Install

Download [OldCord.theme.css](https://github.com/moyaiu/OldCord/blob/a2db5454ffe228be48dee215c1dbeda3b3f71b41/OldCord.theme.css " ") and move it to theme folder

## Or

Put this to custom CSS

```css
@import url("https://moyaiu.github.io/OldCord/src/main.css");
